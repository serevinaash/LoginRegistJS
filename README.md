# Login-SignUp-form-using-HTML-CSS-JS
HTML, CSS, JS project for developing the Login and Signup form with API form registration  using google and Facebook.


So, Its a web development starting app which helps a lot to me make a registeration form.

The concepts which I learn through this projects are
1- position
2- flexbox
3- display, margin, padding and text handling properties.
4- In JS, I learn about the DOM manupulation and a new concept of CLASSLISTTOGGLE.
5- learning about the color schemes, how to make it responsive, developer tools in chrome.

Thanks!
